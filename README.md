# SeahavenTowers
Seahaven Towers game written for the iPad with Pythonista.

Seahaven.py contains the "model" for the game. You can just run it to play the game with a text-based console UI.

SeahavenScene.py contains the "gui" for the game. Run this file to play a nice GUI version of the game.

Warning: the game state is not saved/restored and there is no "new game" button. So to start a new game, you have to stop and re-run.

Currently, every deal is just random, so you may end up with a game that is not solvable. Eventually, I intend to implement a "solver" feature that will check if the game is solvable from the current state.
